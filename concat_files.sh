#!/bin/bash

# A script to concatenate a list of files into a single formatted text block
# and copy it to the clipboard.
#
# Usage:
#   ./script.sh              - Processes predefined files and copies to clipboard.
#   ./script.sh file1.c *.h  - Processes specified files and copies to clipboard.
#   ./script.sh --print      - Processes predefined files and prints to stdout.
#   ./script.sh --print *.py - Processes specified python files and prints to stdout.

# --- Configuration ---
# Add your default files and glob patterns to this list.
# Note: For recursive globs like 'src/**/*.js', 'globstar' must be enabled.

# --- Script Logic ---

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

Please print out whole files. Do not give me just the section that has changed, do not omit parts with comments.

NOTE:

Format every file output the following way: start with a ">> {filename}" followed by a markdown code block and end with "<< end".

EG:

"
>> tests/test_20_something_to_test.yaml
```
# Test something here
...
```
<< end
